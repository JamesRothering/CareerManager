"""Per-field fill-details persistence across the ATS adapter layer.

Regression coverage for the bug that surfaced when the Review queue's
"N of M fields filled" badge opened to "No per-field details were
recorded" -- ``GenericAdapter.apply()`` overrides the base method and
was forgetting to copy ``self._last_fill_details`` onto the result,
so every ``company_site`` / ``workday`` apply produced an empty log.

The tests are deliberately schema-level (no real browser):

* ``_record_fill_details`` must serialise ``FieldMapping`` objects into
  the JSONB-friendly dict shape we persist on ``applications``.
* The result payload serializer must round-trip the new field so the
  Web UI receives it (older adapters that have not migrated yet fall
  back to an empty list rather than ``KeyError``).
