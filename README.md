AutoApply is a local-first job application automation workspace. It helps a job seeker discover roles, score fit, generate tailored application materials, prepare applications, and track outcomes while keeping every submit behind an explicit human decision.

The product combines a Vue/FastAPI operator console, PostgreSQL-backed job and application records, Redis/Celery background work, auditable agent traces, and a provider-agnostic LLM layer supporting OpenAI, Anthropic, Gemini, DeepSeek, Moonshot/Kimi, Qwen, xAI Grok, Groq, Mistral, OpenRouter, Ollama (local), the Claude and Codex CLIs, and user-defined custom OpenAI-compatible providers.

## Product

AutoApply is designed for users who want automation without losing control over sensitive application actions.

- **Job discovery**: Search LinkedIn-discovered roles and supported ATS platforms, normalize postings, and keep a durable Job Index.
- **Fit scoring**: Combine hard rules, semantic matching, freshness checks, and explainability for rejected or borderline jobs.
- **Applicant memory**: Maintain structured profile data, story bank entries, bullet pools, and reusable Q&A material.
- **Materials workspace**: Generate resumes and cover letters from a job or pasted JD, using templates, source documents, and evidence-grounded IR.
- **Document library**: Curate trusted resumes and cover letters, reuse them as generation bases, and promote generated artifacts when they are worth keeping.
- **Automation plans**: Create user-defined recurring tasks that search, scrape, score, prepare materials, and optionally auto-apply eligible jobs.
- **Review and submission**: Review prepared applications, replace materials, approve submissions, and keep submit actions gated.
- **Tracking and analytics**: Track application status, generated artifacts, outcomes, task history, and provider/agent cost telemetry.

## Current Status

Core product development is complete through **Phase 19: Per-Posting Tag Cache & Filter Fast Path** (layered on top of Phase 18: Worker Activation, Reliability, Parallelism, and automatic artifact Cleanup with quarantine/audit).

The current application includes the Job Index, always-refresh search flow, snapshot-level objective tags, per-profile/per-scorer score cache, saved-search fanout through real `search.refresh` children, task queue with closed-out worker bodies (no fake `"scheduled"` / `"stubbed"` success returns), async materials generation that returns `task_id` + structured `TaskRecord.result`, a `dead_lettered` state + "Stuck / failed" tab for retries/discards, an automatic artifact-cleanup pipeline with quarantine + restore + purge, atomic-write protection on every materials writer, process-wide LLM rate-limit gates (global + per-provider), and the existing Phase 17.x surface (review queue, document library, material strategy defaults, multi-vendor provider management with per-provider model catalogs, Settings model picker, custom OpenAI-compatible providers, optional cheap-model tier, LinkedIn session management, modern Vue web console). Browser form-fill now runs through the persisted `application.prepare` → `application.fill` chain and writes results back to the canonical Application row; click-submit remains a separate, approval-gated `application.submit` task, while outcome status sync remains explicit `not_implemented` work. The roadmap from here is **Phase 20** (Custom Job Sources / Connectors with URL safety, bounded multi-source search, and feature-gated template DSL) → **Phase 21** (Multi-tenancy & Auth Hardening) → future ATS-first application status sync.

Latest local verification in this workspace:

- `uv run pytest -q`: 1821 passed, 1 skipped (2026-05-27, after Phase 19 + deployment hardening)
- `npm run build`: passed, with the existing Vite chunk-size warning
- `git diff --check`: passed
- Alembic head: `f6a2c84d9e31` (canonical Application ↔ JobPosting binding plus persisted profile identity).

For implementation-level history, see [Phase History](docs/PHASE_HISTORY.md) and [Changelog](docs/CHANGELOG.md).

## Quick Start

Install dependencies once, then use the unified local launcher:

```powershell
# 1. Set AUTOAPPLY_DB_PASSWORD in .env (any non-empty value), then install deps
uv sync
uv run playwright install chromium
uv run autoapply init

# 2. Start Postgres + Redis, migrations, Celery worker/Beat, and the web UI
uv run autoapply start
```

Open the web console at `http://127.0.0.1:8000`.

The repo ships built-in DOCX template packages under `data/templates/`. On a fresh install, AutoApply initializes any missing built-in default template package once. If a user later deletes a built-in `template.docx`, the template list skips that package instead of crashing or silently recreating it. A fresh install can also start with no applicant profile; create or import one from `/profile` before running scored plan runs.

`autoapply start` runs Docker Compose for **data dependencies**
(Postgres + Redis), applies Alembic migrations, starts Celery worker
and Beat, then launches the Python web app on the host. Use
`uv run autoapply start --check` to print the exact startup plan without
starting anything. If the default host ports are unavailable, the launcher
chooses alternate ports and passes them to Compose, Alembic, Celery, and
the web process for that run. It is cross-platform; Docker Desktop can be
auto-launched on Windows/macOS when installed, while Linux expects the
Docker daemon to already be available. For a single-server production install that runs the
same processes under one supervisor, see `supervisord.conf` and section
15 of [the deployment guide](docs/DEPLOYMENT.md).

If you modify frontend files:

```powershell
cd frontend
npm install
npm run build
```

The repository includes built SPA assets under `src/web/static/spa`, so a frontend rebuild is only required after editing `frontend/`.

## Requirements

| Area | Requirement |
|---|---|
| Python | Python 3.12+ with `uv` |
| Frontend | Node.js and npm for local SPA rebuilds |
| Database | PostgreSQL 16+ with pgvector |
| Browser | Playwright Chromium |
| Cache and queue | Redis for cache, locks, Celery broker, and Beat metadata |
| LLM provider | At least one of OpenAI, Anthropic, Gemini, DeepSeek, Moonshot, Qwen, xAI, Groq, Mistral, OpenRouter, a local Ollama server, the Claude / Codex CLIs, or a user-defined custom OpenAI-compatible endpoint |

## Common Commands

```powershell
# Database schema
uv run alembic upgrade head

# All-in-one local runtime
uv run autoapply start

# Web console only
uv run autoapply web --host 127.0.0.1 --port 8000

# Provider setup
uv run autoapply provider list
uv run autoapply provider set-key openai sk-...
uv run autoapply provider set-primary openai
uv run autoapply provider test openai

# Search and tracking
uv run autoapply search --source linkedin --keyword "software engineer" --location "Canada" --max-pages 3
uv run autoapply status

# Background workers
uv run autoapply worker --queues search,materials,application,maintenance
uv run autoapply beat

# Automation plan runs
uv run autoapply plan-runs run --profile default --top-n 10
uv run autoapply pause-plan-runs --clear-pending
uv run autoapply resume-plan-runs
```

## Safety Model

AutoApply is not intended to be an unchecked autonomous submitter.

- Submit actions are gated by review flows and explicit approval.
- Agents run inside bounded tool registries; they do not receive arbitrary filesystem, database, browser, or network authority.
- Generated materials are evidence-grounded and traceable to profile facts, job snapshots, templates, and source documents.
- PostgreSQL stores durable application, task, review, and job-index state; Redis is treated as derived cache/queue state.
- The UI exposes review queues, task history, provider health, and downloadable artifacts for auditability.
